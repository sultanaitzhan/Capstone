\section{Title}
Approximate expansions for Wave \& KdV equations via the velocity potential and non-local formulations.

\section{Subject Areas}
Differential equations, asymptotic analysis, fluid dynamics, nonlinear waves.

\section{Challenges}
\subsection{Theoretical knowledge}
The approximation procedure for the Euler Equations in the two formulations requires a solid understanding of the Euler's equations and the non-local formulation. 

The student has taken advanced courses such as OPDE and Numerical Analysis. The student will further familiarise himself with the specific topics such as perturbation series, non-local formulation, and Euler's equations over the course of semester 1 and semester 2 as needed.

\subsection{Exploration}
Having finished the theoretical part of the project, what can be done with the results?

\emph{Prof's Response:}

\section{Scope}
Although the wave \& KdV equations have been derived from the Euler's equations on the whole line, no corresponding work has been done in the case a half-line. In addition, it was recently shown that the Euler's equations can be a reduced to one, time-dependent equation. However, the wave \& KdV equations have yet to be derived from the time-dependent equation, for both a whole line, and a half line.

The first goal of this project is to derive the wave \& KdV equations from the Euler's equations on a half-line, by determining an appropriate boundary condition. The second goal is to derive the wave \& KdV equations from the single, time-dependent equation on the whole line and a half-line.

\section{Semester 1 plan with time allocation}

Estimated consultation time is one hour per week. Consultation consists of one-on-one video meetings.
